# Air Pollution Analysis in Lombardy, Italy

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of air pollution levels in the Lombardy region of Italy, focusing specifically on the relationship between air quality and cattle density. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the environmental impact of agricultural practices and to inform stakeholders about potential areas for improvement in air quality management.

## Project Description

The analysis was conducted as part of a collaborative group project, emphasizing teamwork and interdisciplinary approaches to tackling complex environmental issues. Utilizing a robust dataset of pollutant levels and cattle density, we employed various statistical techniques, including linear regression and correlation analysis, to explore the underlying relationships between these variables.

Key findings from our analysis include:

- **Initial Expectations:** Our initial hypothesis posited a strong correlation between atmospheric pollution and cattle density; however, results indicated that this relationship was not statistically significant compared to other pollutants.
- **Data Limitations:** The presence of missing values in pollutant data on selected days highlighted challenges in achieving a complete analysis, potentially affecting the model's precision.
- **Influence of Other Pollutants:** The limited effect of cattle density may be overshadowed by the dominance of other pollutants in the sampled areas, which exert a more pronounced impact on air quality.

## Methodology
We adopted a rigorous analytical approach using **R** as the primary tool for data processing and statistical analysis, which involved:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering extensive datasets from monitoring stations across Lombardy.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Implementing linear regression models in **R** to assess the relationship between variables and identifying potential outliers.
3. **Visualization**: Using **R's ggplot2** library to create informative visualizations to effectively communicate the results and highlight key trends in the data.

## Repository Structure

- `GUstica_Report.html`: A detailed report outlining our findings, methodologies, and visualizations.
- `Agrimonia_stations.RData`: A folder containing raw datasets utilized in the analysis.
- `Script.Rmd`: Scripts used for data processing and statistical analysis.

## Conclusion

This project not only sheds light on the environmental challenges facing Lombardy but also exemplifies the power of data-driven decision-making in addressing air quality issues. By sharing our findings and methodologies, we hope to contribute to ongoing discussions regarding pollution management and sustainability practices in agriculture.

## Future Work

I recommend further studies to explore additional variables that may influence air quality, as well as the implementation of more advanced modeling techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.
